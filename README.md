# librwgta-termux
Just a Termux script that will install goodies from librwgta for GTA games.

Just do the "git clone --recursive https://github.com/GSFGANGSTER27/librwgta-termux" (make sure you install git by doing the "pkg install build-essential git"), do the "cd librwgta-termux", and then "sh librwgta-termux.sh"

It has issues that cannot be solved.
storiesconv don't work.

Not every tools are included (e.g. storiesview) since they are mostly for 3d stuff.

Let me know if you have any other issues installing!
