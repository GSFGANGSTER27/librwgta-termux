# librwgta-termux
Just a Termux script that will install goodies from librwgta for GTA games.

Just download the SH and enter "sh librwgta-tools-termux.sh" on Termux.

It has issues that cannot be solved.
storiesconv don't work.

Not every tools are included (e.g. storiesview) since they are mostly for 3d stuff.

Let me know if you have any other issues installing!
